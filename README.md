Named Entity Recognition with Python 
In machine learning, the recognition of named entities is an essential subtask of natural language processing. It tries to recognize and classify multi-word phrases with special meaning, e.g. people, organizations, places, dates, etc.
Named entity recognition comes from information retrieval (IE). IEâ€™s job is to transform unstructured data into structured information. In Named Entity Recognition, unstructured data is the text written in natural language and we want to extract important information in a well-defined format eg. relational database.
